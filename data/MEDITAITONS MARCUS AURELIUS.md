NTIL philosophers are kings, and the princes of this world have the spirit and power of philosophy, and political greatness and wisdom meet in one, cities will never cease from ill—no, nor the human race, as I believe—and then only will our state have a possibility of life, and see the light of day." "The truth is, that the state in which the rulers are most reluctant to govern is best and most quietly governed, and the state in which they are most willing is the worst." unwillingly, because he loves Thus writes Plato in his Republic, laying down the conditions, which even to him appear impossible, under which a state may be wisely governed. The ruler must be a philosopher as well as a king ; and he must govern philosophy better than Once in the history of the world these condominion. in Marcus Aurelius we find the ditions were fulfilled : philosopher king, the ruler who preferred the solitude of the student to th^ splendour of the palace, the soldier who loved the arts of peace better than the glory of war. It is with no small interest that we turn to the records of history to see what was the outward life led by this king but even more willingly do we open the precious record of — viii MARCUS AURELIUS. his own thoughts, which reveal to us the inner life of the philosopher. Marcus Aurelius Antoninus was the adopted, son of the Emperor Antoninus Pius, who died in 161 a.d. He had been brought up with the utmost care by his adoptive father, and received the best instruction in poetry and rhetoric, at that time the staples of a liberal education. But his favourite study was philosophy, and when only eleven years old he assumed the philosophers' simple dress, adopted their mode of life ; and finding that his inclination was chiefly towards Stoicism, he attached himself to this the strictest of the philosophic schools. A discipline of jOQua^tic severity, that bade its followers disregard all bodily comfort, all that is commonly called pleasure, and care for nought but virtue, was indeed a strange training Eor one destined for the imperial purple, and it hardly appeared to be a fitting preparation for the cares of what was then the one great Empire of the world. True, the Stoics loved to call themselves citizens of the world, and to inculcate that cosmopolitanism that is broader and nobler than mere patriotism ; but while they maintained in theory that the wise man should take part in politics, in practice there was always something in the existing state of things which made his doing so But Marcus Aurelius could not choose his own lot. Destined for the throne already by the Emperor Hadrian, associated in the empire even in his adoptive father's lifetime, he could but unadvisable. practise the noble accept his striving principles he had learnt, pay to his Stoic teachers the truest lot, and in to tribute. ^is was a troubled reign. The Homan Empire, which in the vigorous days of the Republic had been gradually but surely extending its boundaries, had been consolidated, MARCUS AURELIUS. ix and newly administered by Julius Cjesar and Augustus. On the death of the latter it extended from the Atlantic on the west to the Armenian mountains and Arabian deserts on the east. On the south the African deserts had alone stopped the conquering arms, while on the north a line of natural boundaries was traced by the English Channel, Warned Rhine, Danube, Black Sea, and Mount Caucasus. by the ill-success that attended the later campaigns of his generals on the Lower Rhine, Augustus had cautioned his successors to aim at preserving rather than increasing their Thus it came about, that between the years dominions. 14 and 161 a.d., when Marcus Aurelius succeeded to the throne, only two fresh conquests had been made ; Britain, a source of more trouble than profit to the empire, and Dacia, conquered by Trajan in 106 A.D. circle security for many years within the dominion. Natural boundaries and Roman legions kept peace and of Roman But there were two weak points on these On the north the hardy German tribes on the borders. Danube and Upper Rhine, themselves hard pressed by Slavonian intruders from Russia, threatened to invade the Roman dominion ; on the east the " insolent Parthian," long the terror of the Roman arms^ was a constant source of trouble and danger. ..Xlxft pRane-lnvi^g^jIarcus Aurelius The arms, was obliged to cope with both these enemies. or rather the army, of the insolent and profligate Lucius Yerus for a time subdued the Parthians, but no lasting He himself conpeace was destined Marcus Aurelius. ducted the campaigns on the Danube, and again and again beat back the northern enemy in wars, of which the chief interest to us now consists in the scant notes in the Meditations— " This among the Quadi," " this at Carmuntum," showing how these precious records of a pure and X MARCUS A URELIUS. serene soul were composed amid the storms of battle and Nor were his troubles confined to the elation of victory. foreign wars. The plague, imported from the East, ravaged Italy, though it did the state good service in carrying off Lucius Yerus, Marcus's adoptive brother, whom, in obedience to the wishes of Antoninus, he had associated with There were famines too in the himself in the empire. land, with which the Emperor tried to cope by schemes of And, lastly, Avidius Cassius, carefully-organised charity. one of his most trusted and ablest generals, revolted in Syria, and tried to obtain for himself the empire, deeming it an easy matter to overcome a master who was so full of generosity and compassion that he could only inspire contempt in the mind of the unphilosophic soldier. The revolt was soon put down, but the leader was killed by one of his own officers. The Emperor expressed only his regret that he should have been thus deprived of the luxury of forgiveness, and he carefully destroyed all documents that could implicate any others in the revolt. Thus in all the trials of his life his philosophy inspired noble action, and he might worthily be added to the short list of those whom the Stoics acknowledged as really good and great. this Amid these records of gentleness and forbearance it seems strange to read that Marcus Aurelius permitted a cruel persecution of the Christians. Among the victims reign were Justin Martyr and Polycarp, and of numbers suffered in a general persecution of the churches It must not, however, be forat Lyons and Vienne. gotten that the persecution was political rather than Of the true teaching of Christianity Marcus religious.

Not so the Christians. In their eyes the whole system of idolatry was accursed. A silent protest was insufficient. It was not enough to refrain from sacrifice themselves ; in public and in private, in season and out of season, they exhorted others to do the like ; not content with leaving the statues of the gods unhonoured, they would throw them from their pedestals, or insult them in the presence of the faithful.

In 177 a.d. Marcus Aurelius to the very end of his days. fresh wars called him to the north. A presentiment seemed to tell his friends at Kome that they should not see him again, and they begged him to address them his farewell There is nothing more striking in the whole admonitions. of Aurelius' career than this picture of the great general discoursing for three days before his departure for the wars This was indeed the on the deep questions of philosophy. last time he was seen at Kome. Worn out by anxiety and fatigue, after once more winning victory for the Roman arms, he died, in Pannonia, on March 17th, 180 A.D., mourned with a note of such true sorrow as never before or again was raised at the death of an Emperor. It is time to inquire into the nature of that philosophy which was capable of exercising an influence so distinctly yet, when we consider its teaching as laid down practical ; by its founders, its distinct materialism and impracticable ethics afford little sugsrestion of such fruits as it was destined to bear in the Roman world. The Stoic school was founded by Zeno at Athens about At this time Greek philosophy, which, under 290 B.C. Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle, had lived through a short period of idealism, was returning to its naturally materialistic groove, and the founders of new systems looked back physicists for some theory of the to the pre-Socratic MARC US A URELIUS. xiii universe on which they might base their own. Metaphysical speculation had ceased to charm ; it was practical ethics, a rule of life and conduct, that philosophy now desired to supply ; and though these later schools based ethics on science, they were content to go back to the natural old for a system, instead of investigators of themselves on their own account to scientific research. The two most important schools at this epoch were the Stoic and Epicurean ; and while the latter sought in the atomic theory the universe, the former reverted to the " perpetual flux," the eternal, ever-changing fire of Heraclitus. Democritus an explanation devoting of of Before there was a heaven or earth there was a primiThis changes into all the other elements, tive fiery ether. and yet in its nature ever retains the fiery substratum. First this fiery ether transforms itself into a mass of vapour, Out of this are developed the then into a watery fluid. four elements as we know them : water, and solid earth, and atmospheric air, and lastly consuming, destructive fire, which is distinct from the everlasting ether. Fire and air are active elements ; water and earth, passive. The creation begins to assume its present form with earth ; dry earth, by reason of its weight, takes up a position at the centre of the universe, around it gather the waters, above both is the expanse of air, while fire and ether complete the whole, ever circling round the other elements which are at rest. The stars are fiery masses firmly embedded in ether, and nourished by the exhalations of terrestrial vapours. But they are also living beings, since they are formed out of living, animating fire, and they may thus be regarded as " The sun and the celestial inferior •deities, too, have their business assigned," says Marcus Aurelius. or visible gods. xiv MARCUS AURELIUS, The world is faultless, say the Stoics, and must therefore Hence the have been produced by an intelligent artificer. highest reason is immanent in the world, and must be For has it not regarded as self-conscious and personal. created man, who is self-conscious and personal, and can the created be greater than the creator ? And yet, paradoxical as it may seem, the Stoic god is not a person, but is the This fiery substratum fiery ether that pervades all things. of all matter is its soul; the soul of the universe, which holds together all things in one fixed law, is God himself. In one aspect the Deity is but a fiery air-current ; in another he is Zeus, the intelligent, almost personal lord of Both these aspects may be found in Marcus the universe. Aurelius ; but in him the simpler ethical teaching, the gentle exhortation to a virtuous life, predominate over subtle speculation on the origin of things, and be speaks of God in vividly to us the omnipotent, language that omniscient.

Some such scheme of the universe was certainly accepted by all the Stoics, but the later teachers, at any rate, attached little importance to it, except in as far as it demonstrated man's intimate connection with the Deity and his fellowThey believed that the soul was material, and men. extended in space.

And such a life must be in Hence this is the highest eood, accordance with virtue. and happiness consists in virtue. in the class of Thus the Stoics arrive at their main thesis. Virtue alone is admirable, virtue is absolutely self-sufficient ; the good man needs no help from circumstances , neither sickness nor adversity can harm him ; he is a king, a god among men. All so-called good, if it be not moral good, is included " things intermediate," neither good nor Such absolute claims for virtue had never before bad. been made by any school. Aristotle had stipulated for sufficient external advantages to enable a man to devote himself without further care to the life of thought and The Stoics would permit of no such compromise. virtue. Virtue, and virtue only, was what they demanded. The virtuous man might be a slave, a victim to disease, to poverty, might be deprived of all he loved, yet he would Virtue was one and remain solely and absolutely happy. Whoever was not virtuous was vicious ; there indivisible. Here was a point in their doctrine was no middle course. which could hardly be made to square with fact. We know too well that men are not divided into virtuous and vicious, but all possess some share of good and evil, and that most men desire what is right, and fail, when The they do, from weakness rather than viciousness. Stoics, who demanded absolute virtue and disregard of externals, had to confess that the wise men were few and the foolish legion ; nay, when hard pressed to name their wise men, they would give a remarkable list—Hercules, Odysseus, Socrates, the Cynics Antisthenes and Diogenes; and in the later days of the school, Cato the younger, the only Stoic among the number. MARCUS AURELIUS. xvii Such a list alone appears to us sufficient condemnation of Stoicism in its earlier forms. Had no further advance been made, Stoicism would be of small interest to us now, but happily it was destined, as Capes remarks in his little handbook on Stoicism, to be "tempered by concessions to common sense." The paradoxes about the wise man had been borrowed from Cynicism, which was regarded by the Stoics as " a counsel of perfection." Diogenes in his tub, bidding Alexander stand out of his sunshine, might excite surprise and wonder ; but a movement that should lead a whole community to abandon civilisation and resort to life In later times in tubs would be distinctly retrogressive. Christian hermits have at best saved their own souls, and the exhortations delivered by St. Simeon Stylites from the top of his pillar cannot have influenced the gaping multitude as much as a noble life led in their midst. Without the practical element there would have been no life in Christianity, and Stoicism similarly had to descend from its pedestal, and walk among men. First of all, the theory of absolute good and evil had to Virtue was still the only real good, and vice be modified. the only real evil ; but besides these they now admitted a class of " things to be preferred," and another of " things to be avoided." Among the former might be included health, good repute, and other advantages which had formerly been Again, while the summarily disposed of as "indifferent." impossible wise man still remained the ideal of Stoicism, it was admitted that there might be good meD with lofty aims and blameless lives who should yet dwell among men as In short, the wide gap between the sage their fellows. and the fool was now filled up, and as a result the Stoic system was able to find a place for real, existing human beings. — xviii MARCUS AURELIUS. to their own needs. These more practical developments were coincident with its introduction into the Roman world. The Romans were nothing if not practical. A nation of soldiers and lawyers, they had borrowed from Greece her culture, and adapted So too they borrowed their it philosophy. When " conquered Greece led her barbarous conqueror captive," a few of the nobler minds at Rome discovered that there was something at Athens worth Some would spend a year carrying off besides the statues. or two at Athens studying philosophy ; others induced the greatest teachers themselves to bring their doctrines to Rome ; and in the first century B.C. all the Greek systems were represented in the capital of the world. Among them all Stoicism found most adherents. Its teachings of simplicity, resignation, and calm in the midst of disturbance, found willing listeners among the earnest Republicans, who saw their hopes of liberty gradually fading before the that suicide was approaching monarchy. admissible, even admirable, when circumstances made it no longer possible " to take ar as against a sea of troubles," pointed to a mode of escape from the tyranny they could Thus Cato sought death at his own hands when not avert. the Republic perished, and it was Stoic teaching that forbade Brutus and Cassius, though not Stoics themselves, to survive Its doctrine the battle of Philippi. In the early days of the empire, when corruption and license were at their height, the court evinced deep hatred The against the philosophers, more especially the Stoics. outspoken manner in which they chastised the wickedness of the time may have led to their unpopularity ; in any case, there were several decrees of banishment against them, and among the victims at one time was ; xix MARCUS A URELIUS, ** That halting slave, who in Nicopolis Taught Arrian, when Vespasian's brutal son Cleared Rome of what most shamed him." "Well might the name of Epictetus be counted among those who cheer the soul in evil days, for where can sweeter resignation or truer piety be found than in such words as these— " Dare to look up to God and say, Deal with me for the future as thou wilt, I am of the same mind as thou art I am thine : I refuse nothing that pleases thee : lead me where thou wilt : clothe me in any dress thou choosest : is it thy will that I should hold the office of a magistrate, that I should be in the condition of a private man, stay I will make thy here or be an exile, be poor, be rich % defence to men in behalf of all these conditions." These were not empty words, for they found their illustration in the life of the speaker. In the lame slave Stoic ethics rose to its noblest heights • but it was left to the imperial philosopher, by broadening and humanising its teaching, to give to the world in his Meditations " the gospel of those who do not believe in the supernatural." These Meditations were not written as a whole—probably they were never intended for publication ; they are simply the Emperor's commonplace book, where he entered his reflections, often quite unconnected, on the things of time and eternity. By this means he seems to have adopted his own counsel of withdrawing into his own mind, there to seek calm and quiet.

" That which is not for the interest of the •whole swarm is not for the interest of a single bee " (vi. 54). " And It will lead us also to pity and forgive our enemies. since it has fallen to my share to understand the natural beauty of a good action and the deformity of an ill one since I am satisfied the person disobliging is of kin to me, and though we are not just of the same flesh and blood, yet our minds are nearly related, being both extracted from the Deity, I am convinced that no man can do a real injury, because no man can force me to misbehave myself ; nor can I find it in my heart to hate or be angry with one of my own nature and family.

Aurelius loves to dw ell on the instability and insignificance " The vast continents of Europe and Asia of al l things. are but corners of the creation ; the ocean is but a drop, and Mount Athos but a grain in respect of the universe, and the present instant of time but a point to the extent of These things have all of them little, changeable, eternity.

And it is but a little while that it is fixed in one species. Now a tr'ink feels no more pain by being knocked in pieces than when it was first put together " (vii. 23). "Death a^id generation are both mysteries of nature, and somewhrxt resemble each other ; for the first does but dissolvfj those elements the latter had combined" (iv. Amid all this change the only true good is philosophy, which teaches us to keep our guiding principles pure and "Toss me into what untainted by bodily impressions. For all that, I will keep my cliniate or state you please. divine part content if it but exi^t and act in accordance with its nature " (viii. 45). Nothing external can influence u?i, unless we pronounce it good or evil. This is in accordStnce with the Stoic doctrine, that all sensations make a material impression on the soul ; but it is left to the reasoning or guiding principle to decide whether they are true or "Hold in honour your opinionative false, good or evil. faculty, for this alone is able to prevent any opinion from originating in your guiding principle that is contrary to " nature or the proper constitution of a rational creature 5). " Do not suppose you are hurt, and your complaint (iii. 9.) ceases ; cease your complaint, and you are not hurt" (iv. 7), writes the Emperor, using, as he so often does, an obscure dogma to point a practical moral. Such practical teaching abounds in Marcus Aurelius ; but How gladly he quotes Antishe rises to higher flights. thenes's comment on the kingly prerogative. " It is a royal thing to be iL spoken of for good deeds" (vii. 36). How xxii MARCUS AURELIUS. well he satirises the craving for gratitude, so aptly defined by a French writer as the ' usury ' we exact for our good "Some men, when they do you a kindness, at once deeds. demand the payment of gratitude from you ; others are However, they remember the more modest than this. favour, and look upon you as their d.'^btor in a manner. A third sort shall scarce know what they have done. These are much like a vine, which is satisfied by being fruitful in its kind, and bears a bunch of grapes without expecting any thanks for it. A fleet horse or greyhound do noi make a noise when they have done well, nor a bee neither when she has made a little honey. And thus a man th>at has done a kindness never proclaims it, but does another as soon as he can, just like a vine that bears again the next season. Now we should imitate those who are so obliging. as hardly to reflect on their beneficence " (v. 6). And how scathing is this criticism of the aflfectation of virtue ! " How fulsome and hollow does that man look that cries— 'I am resolved to deal straightforwardly with you.' Hark you, friend, what need of all this flourish'? Let your actions I would speak ; your face ought to vouch for your speech. have virtue look out of the eye, no less apparently than I would have love does in the sight of the beloved. honesty and sincerity so incorporated with the constitution that it should be discoverable by the senses" (xi. 15). Here is another gem that sparkles with especial brightness— "The best way of revenge is not to imitate the injury" (vi. 6). Very noble is this conception of the true function of prayer— " This man . . invokes the gods to set him free from some trouble ; let it be your petition that youi' mind may never put you upon such a wish.

We must however briefly inquire how Marcus Aurelius treats those great questions to which each system must find some answer, or The else abandon its claims to be a guide through life. origin of evil is a difficulty that every system has had to It is the first and most obvious ars^ument asrainst The Stoics boldly the existence of an All-wise Providence.

So too Marcus Aurelius : " Wickedness generally does no harm to the universe ; so too in particular subjects it does fio~jiarffi to anyone " (viii. 55). At times he points not to tlie universal law, which he regards as the providence of the universe, but to the existence of gods, who must direct But he never asserts this with any all things for the best. The alternative is between gods and atoms, certainty. between providence and chance ; and though Marcus Aurelius pronounces for the former, he desires to show it alone. — — xxiv MARCUS AURELIUS. As to that even under the latter a man may be content. The the future life, he never speaks with any certainty. guiding principle of the soul can never perish, since it is a part of the Deity ; but whether there is a future selfconscious existence is a question he scarcely touches on. " Though you were des-, if you please, thirty tined _tQ liv^ three thousand, or, thousand years, yet remember that no man can. lose any (Jther life than that which he lives now, neither is he possessed of any other than that which he loses" (ii. 14). The Stoic Emperor cannot say with our modern poet Jliis-lifeis all that concerns us. *' "What is our failure here but a triumph's evidence For the fulness of the days ? Have we withered or agonised ? Why else was the pause prolonged but that singing might issue thence ?

' Epicurus bade his followers depart from life as a guest from a banquet satisfied with his entertainment; the Stoics, in sterner language, bid us leave the stage as an actor who has " Hark ye, friend ; you have been a performed his part. burgher of this great city.

The lovers of Marcus Aurelius have been many, and of Long quotes from the preface to Pierron's translation— " A man illustrious in the church, to the Cardinal Francis Barberini the elder, nephew of Pope Urban YITL, occupied the last years of his life in translating into his native language the thoughts of the Roman difi'use among the faithful the Emperor, in order fertilising and vivifying seeds. He dedicated this transJation to his soul, in order to make it, as he says, redder than his purple at the sight of the virtues of this Gentile." Montesquieu says of Marcus Aurelius : "On sent en soimeme un plaisir secret lorsqu' on parle de cet empereur; on ne pent lire sa vie sans une espece d' attendrissement. . Tel est r efiet qu'il produit qu' on a meilleure opinion de soi-meme parce qu' on a meilleure opinion des hommes." Matthew Arnold, in his Essays in Criticism^ points out with his usual clearness the reason of this popularity— " It is remarkable how little of a merely local or temporary character, how little of those scorice which a reader has to clear away before he gets to the precious ore, how little that even admits of doubt and question, the morality of Marcus Aurelius exhibits." " In general the action Marcus Aurelius prescribes is action which every sound nature must recognise as right, and the motives he assigns are motives which every . . xxvi MARCUS A URELTUS. clear reason must recognise as valid. And so he remains the special friend and comforter of all clear-headed and scrupulous, yet pure and upward-striving souls, in those ages most especially which walk by sight and not by faith, and yet have no open vision. He cannot give such souls, perhaps, all they yearn for, but he gives them much, and what he gives them they can receive." Perhaps there never was an age that more needed such teaching than our own. On one hand, sectarian hatred and dogmatism almost obscure the great truths common to all mankind ; on the other, merciless and destructive criticism, in undermining much that used to be generally accepted, seems at times to threaten even the foundations of truth.

By the recollection of my father's character, I learned to be both modest and manly. 3, As for my mother, she taught me to have regard for religion, to be generous and open-handed, and not only to forbear from doing anybody an ill turn, but not so much as to endure the thought of it. By her likewise I was bred to a plain, inexpensive way of living, very different from l;he common luxury of the rich. 4. I have to thank my great-grandfather that I did not go to a public school, but had good masters at home, and learnt to know that one ought to spend liberally on such things. lo MEDITATIONS. 5. From my governor I learned not to join either the green or the blue faction on the race-ground, nor to support the Parmularius or Scutarius at the gladiators' shows. He taught me also to put my own hand to business upon occasion, to endure hardship and fatigues, and to throw the necessities of nature into a little compass ; that I ought not to meddle with other people's business, nor be easy in giving credit to informers.

He also procured me the instruction of Bacchius, Tandasis, and Marcianus. He likewise put me upon improving myself by writing dialogues when I was a boy; prevailed with me to prefer a couch covered with hides to a bed of state ; and reconciled me to other like rio;ours of the Grecian discipline. 7.

He also bade me make nature and reason my rule to live by. By his precedent I was instructed to appear with an unaffected gravity, to study the temper and circumstances of my friends in order to oblige them. I saw him bearing with the ignorant and undiscerning, complaisant and obliging to all people, so that his conversation was more charming than flattery ; and yet at the same time he was held in the highest reverence by others. Conversing with this philosopher helped me to draw up a true, intelligible, and methodical scheme for life and manners, and never so much as to show the least sign of anger, or any other disturbing thought, but to be perfectly calm and indifferent^ However, he let me see in himyet tender-hearted. self that a man might show his good-will significantly enough, without noise and display, and likewise possess great knowledge without vanity and ostentation. 10. Alexander the Grammarian taught me not to be ruggedly critical about words, nor find fault with people for improprieties of phrase or pronunciation, but to set them right by speaking the thing properly myself, and that either by way of answer, assent, or inquiry, or by some such other indirect and suitable correction. 11. Fronto taught me that envy, tricking, and dissimulation are the character and consequences of those we call patricians have tyranny ; and that commonly not much fatherly feeling in them. 12. Alexander the Platonist advised me, that without necessity I should never say to anyone, nor write MEDITATIONS. ; in a letter, that I am not at leisure, nor make business an excuse to decline frequently the offices of humanity to those we dwell with. 13. I learned of Catulus not to slight a friend for making a remonstrance, though it should happen to be unreasonable, but rather to endeavour to restore him to his natural humour. That, like Domitius and Athenodotus, I should always speak well of those who had the care of my education, and that I should always preserve an hearty affection for my children. 14. I am indebted to Severus for the love I bear to my relations, and towards justice and trath. He likewise made me acquainted with the character and sentiments of Cato, Brutus, Thrasea, Helvidius, and Dio and gave me the idea of an equal commonwealth, with equal rights and equal speech, and also of a monarchy, where the liberty of the subject was principally regarded. To mention some more of my obligations to him :—It was of him I learned not to grow wise by starts and sudden fancies, but to be a constant admirer of philosophy and improvement ; that a man ought to be generous and obliging, hope the best of matters, and never question the affection of his friends ; to be free in showing a reasonable dislike of another, and no less clear in his own expectations and desires ; and not to put his friends to the trouble of divining what he would be at. 15.

In my adoptive father I observed a smooth and inoffensive temper, with great steadiness in keeping close to measures judiciously taken ; a greatness proof against vanity and the impressions of pomp and power.

No ; he was a person mature and perfect, scorning flattery, and thoroughly qualified to govern himself and others. As for those that were philosophers in earnest, he had a great regard for them, but without reproaching those who were otherwise, nor yet being led away by these. He was condescending and familiar in conversation^ i6 MEDITATIONS. and pleasant too, but not to tiresomeness and excess. As for his health, he was not anxious about it, like one fond of living, or over-studious of bodily appearance, and yet managed his constitution with that care as seldom to stand in need of the assistance of phj^sic or outward applications. Farther, he never envied and browbeat those that were eminent in any faculty or science, as eloquence, or knowledge of the laws or morals ; but, on the contrary, encouraged them in their ways, and promoted their reputation. He observed fitness and custom in all his actions, and yet did not seem to regard them. He was not fickle and fluttering in his humour, but constant both to place and undertaking; and I have seen him, after violent fits of the headache, return fresh and vigorous to his usual business. He kept but few things to himself, and those were secrets of government. He was very moderate and frugal in shows, public buildings, liberalities, and such like, being one that did not so much regard the popularity as the rightIt was none of his custom to bathe ness of an action. at unusual hours, or to be overcome with the fancy of building, to study eating and luxury, to value the curiosity of his clothes, or the shape and person of his His cloak came from Lorium, his villa on servants. the coast; at Lanuvium, he wore for the most part only a tunic; and at Tusculum he would scarcely so much as put on a cloak without making an excuse To take him altogether, there was nothing of for it. ruggedness, immodesty, or eagerness in his temper.

Things were dispatched at leisure, and without being felt ; and j^et the administration was carried on without confusion, with great order, force, and uniformity. Upon the whole, what was told of Socrates is applicable to him ; for he was so much master of himself, that he could either take or leave those conveniences of life with respect to which most people are either uneasy without them, or intemperate with them. Now, to hold on with fortitude in one condition and sobriety in the other is a proof of a great soul and an impregnable virtue, such as he showed in the sickness of Maximus. ties. sister, relations, preceptors, 17.

Farther, it is from them that my wife is so very obedient and affectionate, and so remote from luxury that I had choice of good governors for my children that remedies were prescribed me in a dream against giddiness and spitting of blood, as at Cajeta, by ointment ; that when I had a mind to look an into philosophy, I did not meet with a sophist to instruct me ; that I did not spend too much time in reading history, chopping logic, or considering the heavens.

Take care always to remember that you are a man and a E-oman ; and let every action be done with perfect and unaffected gravity, humanity, freedom, and justice. And be sure you entertain no fancies, which may give check to these qualities. This is possible, if you will but perform every action as though it were your last ; if your appetites and passions do not cross upon your reason ; if you keep clear of rashness, and have nothing of insincerity and self-love to infect you, and do not complain of your destiny.

These reflections ought always to be at hand : To consider well the nature of the universe and my own nature, together with the relation betwixt them, and what kind of part it is, of what kind of whole ; and that no mortal can hinder me from acting and speaking conformably to the being of which I am a pari;. 10. Theophrastus, in comparing the degrees of faults (as men would commonly distinguish them), talks like a philosopher when he affirms that those instances of misbehaviour which proceed from desire are greater than those of which anger is the occasion. Por a man that is angry seems to quit his hold of reason unwillingly and with pain, and start out of rule before But he that runs riot out of desire, he is aware. being overcome by pleasure, loses all hold on himself, and all manly restraint.

Manage all your actions, words, and thoughts accordingly, since you may at any moment quit life. And what great matter is the business of dying ? If the gods are in being, you can suffer nothing, for they will do you no harm. And if they are not, or take no care of us mortals—why, then, a world without either gods or Providence is not worth a man's while But, in truth, the being of the gods, and to live in. their concern in human affairs, is beyond dispute.

I can never be persuaded that the universal Nature neglected these matters through want of knowledge, or, having that, yet lacked the power to prevent or correct the error ; or that Nature should commit such a fault, through want of power or skill, as to suffer things, really good and evil, to happen promiscuously to good and bad men.

Consider how quickly all things are dissolved and resolved ; the bodies and substances themselves into the matter and substance of the world, and their memories into its general age and time. Consider, too, the objects of sense, particularly those which charm us with pleasure, frighten us with pain, or are most admired for empty reputation. The power of thought will show a man how insignificant, despicable, and paltry these things are, and how soon they wither and die.

Besides, they are often to be pitied for their ignorance of good and evil; which incapacity of discerning between moral qualities is no less a defect than that of a blind man, who cannot distinguish between white and black. 14. Though you were to live three thousand, or, if you please, thirty thousand of years, yet remember that no man can lose any other life than that w^hich he now lives, neither is he possessed of any other than that which he loses. Whence it follows that the longest life, as we commonly speak, and the shortest, come all to the same reckoning. For the present is of the same duration everywhere. Everybody's loss, therefore, is of the same bigness, and reaches no further than to a point of time, for no man is capable of losing either the past or the future ; for how can one be deprived of what he has not ? So that under this consideration there are two notions worth rememJbering. One is, that Nature treads in a circle, and has much the same face through the whole course And therefore it signifies not at all of eternity. whether a man stands gazing here an hundred, or two hundred, or an infinity of years ; for all that he gets is only to see the same sights so much the by it The other hint is, that when the longest cftener. and shortest-lived persons come to die, their loss is equal ; they can but lose the present as being the only thing they have ; for that which he has not, no man can be truly said to lose. 15. Monimus, the Cynic philosopher, used to say 3o MEDITATIONS. that all things were but opinion. Now this saying may undoubtedly prove serviceable, provided one accepts it only as far as it is true. 16. There are several different ways by which a man's soul may do violence to itself ; first of all, when it becomes an abscess, and, as it were, an excrescence on the universe, as far as in it lies. For to be vexed at anything that happens is a separation of ourselves from nature, in some part of which the natures of all Secondly, it falls under other things are contained. the same misfortune when it hates any person, or goes against him, with an intention of mischief, which is the case of the angry and revengeful.

Now, this consists in keeping the divinity within us from injury and disgrace, superior to pleasure and pain, doing nothing at random, without any dissembling and pretence, and independent of the motions of Farther, philosophy brings the mind to take things as they fall, and acquiesce in their distribution, inasmuch as all events proceed from the same cause with itself ; and, above all, to have an easy prospect of death, as being nothing more than a dissolving of the elements of which each thing is composed. Now, if the elements themselves are never the worse for runnino' off one into another, what if they should all change and be dissolved ?

For if the man begins to dote, it is true the mere animal life goes on he may breathe, and be nourished, and be furnished with imagination and appetite; but to make any proper use of himself, to fill up the measure of his duty, to distinguish appearances, and to know whether it is time for him to walk out of the world or not—as to all such noble functions of reason and judgment, the man is perfectly dead already. It concerns us, therefore, to push forward, and make the most of our continually advancing ; and matters, for death is besides that, our understanding sometimes dies before us. 2. It is worth while to observe that the least thing that happens naturally to things natural has something in itself that is pleasing and delightful 36 MEDITATIONS, Thus, for example, there are cracks and little breaks on the surface of a loaf, which, though never intended by the baker, have a sort of agreeableness in them, Thus figs, when they are which invites the appetite. most ripe, open and gape ; and olives, when they fall of themselves and are near decaying, are particularly The bending of an ear of corn, the pretty to look at. brow of a lion, the foam of a boar, and many other things, if you take them singly, are far enough from being beautiful ; but when they are looked on as effects of the products of Nature, help to adorn and attract. Thus, if a man has but inclination and thought enough to examine the product of the universe, he will find the most unpromising appearances in the results of Nature not without charm, and that the more remote appendages have somewhat to recommend them.

No; he keeps himself to his own business, and contemplates that portion of the whole allotted him by the fates, and endeavours to do the first as it should be, and believes that his lot is good. For every man's fate is suitable, since it is suited to him. He considers that the rational principle is akin in all men, and that general kindness and concern for the whole world is no more than a piece of human nature—that not every one's good opinion is not worth the gaining, but only that of those who seek to live As for others, he knows in accordance with Nature. their way of living, both at home and abroad, by day and by night, and their companions in their evil way And, why, indeed, of life, and he bears it in mind. should he value the commendation of such people, who are not able even to please themselves ? 5.

Think nothing for your interest which makes you break your word, quit your modesty, hate, suspect, or curse any person, or inclines you to any practice which will not bear the light and look the world in the face. For he that values his mind and the worship of his divinity before all other things, need act no tragic part, laments under no misfortune, and wants neither solitude nor company ; and, which is still more, he will neither fly from life nor pursue it, but is perfectly indifferent about the length or shortness of the time in which his soul shall be encompassed by his body. And if he were to expire this moment, he is as ready for it as for any other action that may be performed with modesty and decency. For all his life long, this is his only care—that his mind may always be occupied as befits a rational and social creature. 8.

Now, since these qualities are common, let us find out the mark of a man of probity. His distinction, then, lies in letting reason guide his practice, in contentment with all that is allotted him, keeping pure the divinity within him, untroubled by a crowd of appearances, preserving it tranquil, and obeying it as a god. He is all truth in his words and justice in his actions ; and if the whole world should disbelieve his integrity, dispute his character, and question his happiness, he would neither take it ill in the least, nor turn aside from that path that leads to the aim of life, towards which he must move pure, calm, well -prepared, and with perfect resignation in his fate, BOOK IV. .

By looking back into history, and considering the fate and revolutions of government, you will be able to draw a guess, and almost prophesy upon the future ; for they will certainly be of the same nature, and cannot but be cast in the same mould.

Never make any rambling enquiries affcer other people's thoughts, but look directly at the mark which Nature, I say, either that of the nature has set you. universe or your own ; the first leads you to submission to Providence, the latter to act as becomes you.

Which way are we to conclude that Socrates was a better man in virtue and temper than Telauges ? To make out this, it is not enough to say that he disputed better with the sophists, and died more bravely ; that he passed the night in the cold with more endurance, and that when he was bidden to arrest Leon of Salamis, he held it nobler to refuse ; that he walked with a swaggering air in the streets, though the truth of this last particular may be questioned. To prove the point, we must examine what sort of soul Socrates Could he be contented with carried about with him. the conscience of an honest and a pious man ?

It is great folly not to part with your own faults which is possible, but to try instead to escape from other people's faults, which is impossible. 72. Whatever business tends neither to the improvement of your reason, nor the benefit of society, the rational and social faculty thinks beneath it. 73. When you have done a kindness, and your neighbour is the better for it, why need you be so foolish as to look any farther, and gape for reputation and requital ? 74. Nobody is ever tired of advantages. Now to act in conformity to the laws of nature is certainly an advantage. Do not you therefore grow weary of doing good ofiices, whereby you receive the advantage. 75.

It is the work of Providence to change the face of things, and remove them from one place to another. All conditions are subject to revolution, so that you need not be afraid of anything new, for all things are usual, and equally distributed. 7. Every being is at ease when its powers move regularly and without interruption. Now a rational being is in this prosperous condition when its judgment is gained by nothing but truth and evidence, when its designs are all meant for the advantage of society, when its desires and aversions are confined to objects within its power, when it rests satisfied with the distributions of the universal nature of which it is a part, just as much as a leaf belongs to the nature of Only with this difference, that the tree that bears it. a leaf is part of a nature without sense or reason, and to be checked in its operations, whereas a liable man is a limb as it were of an intelligent, righteous, and irresistible being, that is all wisdom, and assigns matter and form, time, force, and fortune, to everything And this you will in one measure and proportion. easily perceive if you do not compare one thing with another in every detail, but compare the whole of one thing with the whole of another. 8.

Would it not be an odd instance of surprise to stare at a fig-tree for bearing figs ? Why then should it seem strange to us for the world to act like itself, and produce things pursuant to quality and kind ? This is just as foolish as it would be for a physician to wonder at a fever, or a master of a vessel at a cross blast of wind. 16.

Turn your body the wrong side outwards, and see it as it is, and consider what age and disease will make of you, and consider that both the orator and the hero, the praiser and the praised, will quickly be out of sight, and that we live but in a corner of this little dimension, that men differ in their notions of honour and esteem, and that even the same person is not of the same opinion long together, and, moreover, that the earth is but a point. 22.

He that is well tinctured with philosophy needs but a short receipt, a common cordial will keep up such a man's spirits and expel fear from his heart. For instance " As leaves on trees the race of man is found, Now green in youth, now withering on the ground." So your children are but leaves. Leaves, too, are the echoes of praise, and censure, and silent blame, and reproach. Leaves, too, are the continuance of fame. All these matters, like leaves, have their spring for growing, then a puff of wind sends them packing, and quickly after the wood is new furnished again. Things are strangely short-lived, and yet you fear and pursue them as if all were everlasting, but for all that, you will soon close your eyes, and then he that is your chief mourner will quickly want another for himself.

However, such company any objects of my care and kindness, those people for whom I have drudged and contrived, and wished so heartily, count my life no better than a grievance, and would fain be rid of me ; now who would be fond of staying this in thought must not go so deep as to sour your humour. You must keep your temper, and part friendly with every body, but then your good nature must not make For as when a man has an easy you hang back. death, the soul slides gently out of the body, so you must walk off handsomely, and bid the world adieu It is true, nature has twisted your without regret. interests, and tied you together, but now she loosens the knot, and makes the sign to disengage. I will part then with the world as with my friends and relations, but for all my kindness I will not be dragged from them but go of my free will. For this too is ordained by nature. 37. Let it be your constant method to look into the design of people's actions, and see what they would be at, as often as it is practicable ; and to make this custom the more significant, practise it first upon yourself. 38.

The way to despise the pleasure of a fine song, a well-performed dance, or the athletic exercises, is as follows : as for the song, take the music in pieces and examine the notes by themselves, and ask as you go along, " Is it this or this single sound, that has subdued me ? " You will be ashamed to confess the Thus, to lessen the diversion of dancing, conquest. consider every movement and gesture apart; and this method will hold with respect to athletic contests. In short, all things but virtue and virtuous acts abate by taking them asunder, and, therefore, apply the expedient to all other parts of your life. 3. What a brave soul is that that is always prepare'd to leave the body and unconcerned about her being either extinguished, scattered, or removed—preobstinacy like the Christians—but with a solemn air of pared, I say, upon judgment, and not out of mere gravity and consideration, and in a way to persuade another and without tragic show. 4.

And don't regard your anger ; Once more " J^'ate mows down life like corn, this mortal falls, Another stands a while." And others like them. Next to tragedy, old comedy took a turn upon the stage ; and here pride and ambition were lashed and pointed at with great freedom and authority, and not without some success ; and for this reason, Diogenes sometimes borrowed from them. You are now to observe that middle comedy succeeded to the old, and the new to the middle, this last kind sinking by degrees to the buffoonery of the mimi.

To bestow no more upon objects than they deserve ; and where things are indifferent, to let our thoughts be so too, is a noble expedient for happiness, and this faculty we have in our souls. The way to attain to this indifference is to look through matters, and take them quite asunder, remembering always that things cannot enter into the soul, nor force upon us any opinions about them ; they are quiet. It is our fancy that makes opinions about them ; it is we that write within ourselves, though it is in our power And if any false colours are laid on by not to write. surprise, we may rub them out if we please. We are likewise to consider that this trouble will not last, Where, then, is the that death will relieve us soon. difficulty of standing upon our guard a little while ? If these things are in accordance with nature, bid them heartily welcome, and then your inclination will make you easy ; but if they prove contrary to nature, look out for something that is more serviceable to your nature, and pursue that, even if it bring you no glory. For certainly every man may make himself happy if he can. 17.

Secondly. Consider what men are at bed and board, and at other times ; especially you should remember what strong compulsion of opinion they lie under, and with what pride they perform their acts. Thirdly. Consider that if those men are in the right, you have no reason to be angry ; but if they are in the wrong, it is because they know no better. They are under the necessity of their own ignorance. For as no soul is voluntarily deprived of truth, so nobody would offend against good manners, if they And thus we see people were rightly aware of it. will not endure the charge of injustice, ingratitude, or knavery of any description, without selfishness, being stung at the imputation. Fourthly. Do not forget you are like the rest of the world, and faulty yourself in a great many instances : that though you may forbear from some errors, it is not for want of inclination, and that nothing but cowardice, vanity, or some such base principle hinders you from sinning. Fifthly. That it is sometimes a hard matter to be MEDITATIONS, certain whether men do wrong, for their actions often are done with a reference to circumstances ; and one must be thoroughly informed of a great many things before he can be rightly qualified to give judgment in the case. Sixthly, When you are most angry and vexed remember that human life lasts but a moment, and that we shall all of us very quickly be laid in our graves. Seventhly, Consider that it is not other people's actions (for they are lodged in their ruling principles), which disturb us, but only our own opinions about them.

But then to give them leave to plague madness. other folks, and desire to be privileged yourself, is a foolish and insolent expectation. 19. There are four evil qualities we must be particularly careful to avoid, and pull them up as fast as we find them, and address them as they rise in this fashion. " This fancy," say, " is unnecessary ; this rough behaviour destroys society ; this phrase I cannot Now this is most absurd, not say from my heart. These are three of them ; to speak from your heart." and when you shall reproach yourself for anything, since this degrades the diviner part of you, makes your mind truckle to your body, and your reason to your pleasures, look upon that as the fourth. 20.

He that does not always drive at the same end in his life will never be uniform and of a piece in his But this hint is too short, unless you conduct. describe the quality that we ought principally to aim at. Now as people do not agree in the preferences of the things that in some way seem good to the many, unless in what relates to the common good, so a man ought to propose the benefit of society and the general interest of the world as his main aim. For he that levels at this mark will keep an even hand, and thus be always consistent with himself 22. Remember the story of the country and the town mouse, and how pitifully the former was frightened and surprised. 28. Socrates used to say the common objects of scare terror were nothing but bogies, fit only to children. 24. The Lacedaemonians, at their public shows, seated strangers under a canopy in the shade, but made their own people take their convenience as they found it. 25. Socrates, being invited to Perdiccas's court, made his excuse :—I dare not come, says he, for fear of being put under an incapacity of returning an MEDITATIONS. obligation, which I take to be the worst way of destroying a man imaginable. 26. It is a precept of the Ephesian philosophers, that we should always furnish our memory with some eminent example of ancient virtue. Ii7. The Pythagoreans would have us look up into the sky every morning, to put us in mind of the order and constancy of the heavenly bodies, of the equality and purity of their matter, and how frankly they lie open to observation : for a star never wears a veil. 28. Remember how unconcernedly Socrates wore a sheepskin, when Xanthippe had got his on, And how well he laughed off and ran out with it. the matter to his friends, who were strangely out of Countenance by seeing him in such a disguise. coat 29.

He is a madman that expects figs on the trees in winter ; and he is little better that calls for his children again when they are dead and buried. o4. Epictetus would have a man when he is kissing and caressing his child, say to himself at the same time : To-morrow perhaps you may die and leave me. These are words of ill omen, you will say. That is your mistake; the conseq^uences of mortality and the " MEDITATIONS. course of nature are no ominous things to tliiuk on, otherwise it would be an ominous business to cut down a little grass or corn. 85. Grapes are first sour, then ripe, then raisins, these are all no more than bare alterations ; not into nothing, but into something which does not appear at present. 36. As Epictetus observes, nobody can rob another of his free will. 37. The same philosopher has taught us the art of managing our assent and movements ; that we should have a regard to circumstances ; that our inclinations should be generous and benevolent, and proportioned to the merit and dignity of things ; that we must keep our desires from being headstrong, and never have an aversion for anything which it is out of our power to hinder. 38. Therefore, as Epictetus observes, the contest is no trifle, but whether we are to live in our wits or out of them. of a beast in you ? 89. It is a saying of Socrates to some untoward people : " What would you be at ? Would you have the soul of a man or Of a Of what sort of men, of those that use their man. Of the first.

You consist of three parts—your body, your The first two are yours to breath, and your mind. take care of, but the latter is properly your person. Therefore, if you abstract from the notion of yourself, that is, of your mind, whatever other people either say or do, or whatever you may have said or done yourself formerly, together with all that disturbs you under the consideration of its coming to pass hereafter ; if you throw the necessary motions of your carcass out of the definition, and those of the vortex that whirls about you, and by this means preserve your rational faculties in an independent state of innocence, free from the allotments of -fate, holding close and steady to the virtues of justice, truth, and acquiif I say, you keep your mind separate and escence ; MEDITATIONS, distinguished from the objects of appetite and the events of time, both past and future, and make yourself like Empedocles's world, " Eound as a ball in joyous rest reposing," and concern yourself to live no longer than your real life, that is the present moment ; if you do all this, you may move on till death stops you, with credit and in harmony with the deity within you. 4. I have often wondered how it comes to pass that everybody should love themselves best, and yet value their neighbour's opinion about themselves more Therefore, if any god or eminent than their own. instructor should stand at a man's elbow and order him to turn his inside outwards, and publish every thought and fancy as fast as they came into his head, lie would not submit so much as to a day's discipline ; thus we stand more in awe of our neighbour's judgments than our own. all things so 5. How comes it that since the gods have conwell, and so much to the trived benefit of mankind, they should overlook this particular, and suffer men of great virtue and merit, who, by their piety and devotion, were, as it were, in communion with the powers above, and kept always a correspondence with heaven, that they should suffer such men, I say, to be finally extinguished by death, and not give them their being again ? Now, if the case stands thus, you may be assured had it been proper, the gods would have ordered it otherwise ; for had it been right it would have been possible, and 20d MEDITATIONS, nature would certainly have brought it forth if it had been natural ; therefore from its not being matter of fact, if indeed it is not, you may undoubtedly conclude it For do not you perceive that in ought not to be so. reasoning this point you dispute the administration of Now, if the justice and goodness of the providence ? gods were not extraordinary, this liberty would not be allowed, neither would you presume so far if you thought otherwise ; but, if they have these perfections, they will never neglect their affairs, nor blemish their world with anything that is unreasonable or unjust. 6. Accustom yourself to master things which you seem to despair of, for, if you observe, the left hand, though, for want of practice, it is insignificant in other business, yet it holds the bridle better than the right because it has been used to it. 7. Consider what death will make of you, both as to body and mind, recollect the shortness of life, the immeasurable extent of time, both past and future, and how slenderly all things are put together. 8. Let it be your method to contemplate spirits apart from the shell they are shut up in, mind the aim of people's actions, examine the value of fame, the force of pain and pleasure, and see what death amounts to, and what reputation, consider upon what account a man grows troublesome to himself, that nobody can be hindered by another, and that everything is opinion. 9. We must manage the precepts of philosophy like those that wrestle and box in the circus, and not like a gladiator ; for your fencer if he drops his sword is hewn down immediately, but the other that makes MEDITATIONS. weapons of his limbs has nothing to do but to keep his hands stirring. 1 0. Be not satisfied with a superficial view of things, but penetrate into their matter and form, and the end they were made for. 11.. What a mighty privilege is a man born to, since it is in his power not to do anything but what God Almighty approves, and to be satisfied with all the distributions of Providence. 12. When things follow from the course of nature, we ought not to blame the gods, for they do no wrong either willingly or against their will, nor yet men, for their misbehaviour is all involuntary. Therefore we must complain of nobody. 13. How unacquainted is that man with the world, and how ridiculous does he appear, that makes a wonder of anything he meets with in this life ! 14. Either the order of things is fixed by irrevocable fate, or providence may be worked into compassion, or else the world floats at random without any steerage. Now if nature lies under an immovable necessity, to what purpose should you struggle against If the favour of providence is to be gained, it ? qualify yourself for the divine assistance ; but if chance and confusion prevail, be you contented that in such a storm you have a governing intelligence within you, and if the waves run too high, let them carry away your body, your breath, and all things else, but there is no necessity your mind should be driven with them. 15. A lamp till it is extinguished holds its light, w^^d shines without interruption, and can you find in 202 MEDITATIONS. your heart to see your truth, honesty, and sobriety extinguished before you ? 16. When you fancy anyone has transgressed, say this to yourself : How do I know it is a fault ? And granting it is, it may be his conscience has corrected him, and if so, he has torn his own face. Besides, you are to remember, that to wish an evil man should not do amiss, is just as wise as it would be to desire that a fig-tree should not bear juice in the figs, that children should not squall, nor horses neigh, nor a great many other things act according to the necessity Pray, how would you have a man of their condition. of such an unfortunate disposition behave himself? If you are angry, try to cure him. 17. If it is not seemly never do it, if it is not true, never speak it, for your impulse should always be under your control. 18. Look always nicely into whatever makes an impression upon your mind, distinguishing it into cause and matter ; and consider its purpose and design and the period of time, beyond which it is unlikely to continue. 19. Consider, for it is high time, that you have something more divine in you than the mechanism of What is there passion, than the wires of a puppet. now in my soul ? Is it fear, or suspicion, or desire ? Or anything of this coarse nature ? never to do without thought, and design, nor for any other end but what may be serviceable to the interest of society. 20. Take care anything 21. Consider that in a little time you will neither MEDITATIONS. ; : have place, nor being, that your contemporaries will have the same fate, and the present scene of nature For all things are formed by nature to be shut up. change and turn and drop in pieces, that new ones may be continually made ont of them. 22. Remember that all things are opinion, and that it is in your own power to think as you please. Therefore remove the opinion, and then as if you had doubled some dangerous cape, you will have nothing but a steady course, a smooth sea, and a waveless bay to receive you. 23. Every activity that ceases in due time, suffers nothing by breaking off: Neither does the agent receive any harm from this. Thus life, Avhich is nothing but a series and continuation of action, comes to no harm by having a seasonable period put to it Neither does he who has ended this series in due time Now nature assigns the term of sustain any loss. sometimes this period is fixed by particular life ; nature, as it happens when a man dies of old age late or early, common nature has but let it con And thus the parts of nature certainly a hand in it. changing from one form to another preserve the whole Now that is world in perpetual youth and vigour. always good and reasonable which makes for the From hence it follows that service of the universe. bare dying can be no real evil, seeing there is nothing disgraceful in it, for it is both involuntary with respect to ourselves, and serviceable to the general interest. Therefore, it is suitable, and seasonable, and profitable to the universe, is certainly a good thing, since it 204 MEDITATIONS. for he that follows the Deity with his motions, and is led by his will to the same ends, is led by God himself. 24. Let these three hints lie ready for service. First, As to your own actions let nothing be done rashly nor to no purpose, nor indeed in any other manner than justice itself would have ordered it. And as for external fortune, consider that it is the blind distribution of chance or else the appointment of providence. Now either to murmur against chance or impeach providence is extremely absurd. Secondly, Consider what a slight thing man is from his conception till he receives his soul ; and from its reception till its loss ; consider too the parts of his composition and Thirdly, Consider that if the state of his dissolution. you could shoot yourself at pleasure into the sky and thence take a view of human affairs, you would perceive a strange medley of condition, and discover at the same time the air, and ether too, plentifully stocked And that if you mounted never so with inhabitants. often, you would have the old prospect. Alas ! things are generally of the same complexion and of the same short continuance too, and yet how strangely we are conceited of them. 25. Discharge opinion and you are safe ; and pray who can hinder you from doing it ? 26. When you are uneasy upon any account, you have forgotten that all things fall out according to the nature of the universe, and that another man's fault is no concern of yours, that what you reckon grievances is nothing but the old way of the world and will come over again, and is now to be met with m a MEDITATIONS. thousand places.

Reflect frequently upon those that have formerly been mightily disturbed with accidents of any kind, that have carried their animosities and feuds to the most flaming excess, that have made the most glorious figure or met with the greatest misfortune, and then ask yourself, Where are they all now ? They are vanished like a little smoke, they are nothing but ashes, and a tale, or not even a tale. Recollect likewise everything of this sort, what Fabius Catullinus did at his country seat ; Lucius Lupus, in his garden ; Stertinius, at Raise ; Tiberius, at Capreae ; Rufus, at Velia, in short, the overweening importance attached to anything whatsoever ; and know that the prize is insignificant, and the play not worth the candle. It is much more becoming a philosopher to stand clear of affectation, to be honest and temperate upon all occasions, and to follow cheerfully wherever the gods lead on, for nothing is more scandalous than a man that is proud of his humility. 28. To those that ask me the reason of my being 2o6 MEDITATIONS. so earnest in religious worship, and whether I ever saw any of the gods, or which way 1 am convinced of the certainty of their existence ; in the first place, I answer, But granting they that the gods are not invisible. were, the objection would signify nothing, for I never had a sight of my own soul, and yet I have a great And thus by my constant experience of value for it. the power of the gods I have a proof of their being, and a reason for my veneration. 29.

The light of the sun is but one and the same, though it is divided by the interposition of walls and mountains, and abundance of other opaque bodies. There is but one common matter, though it is parcelled out among bodies of different qualities. There is but one sensitive soul too, notwithstanding it is divided among innumerable natures and individual And lastly, the rational soul, though it limitations. seems to be split into distinction, is but one and the the other parts same. above-mentioned, such as breath and matter, though without apprehension, or any common affection to tie them to each other, are yet upheld by an intelligent being, and by that faculty which pushes things of the same nature to the same place ; but human underNow, excepting this last, MEDITATIONS. ! standings have a peculiar disposition to union ; they stick together by inclination, and nothing can extinguish such sociable thoughts in them. 31.

Consider all this, and reckon nothing great, unless it be to act in conformity to your own reason, and to suffer as the universal nature shall appoint you. 33. The great business of a man is to improve his mind, therefore consider how he does this. As for all other things, whether in our power to compass or not, they are no better than lifeless ashes and smoke. 34. We cannot have a more promising notion to set us above the fear of death, than to consider that it has been despised even by that sect who made pleasure and pain the standard of good and evil. 2o8 MEDITATIONS. 35.

THE END OF THE TWELVE BOOKS OF THE EMPEROR MARCUS A.URELTUS ANTONINUS. NOTES. BOOK I. 1. Anniiis Verus was his grandfather's name. 2, 3. Annius Verus was also his father's name ; his mother's was Domitia Cal villa. The Emperor T. Antoninus Pius married the sister of Annius Verus, and was thus by marriage the uncle of Marcus Aurelius Antoninus, whom he adopted. 7, 8. Q. Junius Rusticus and ApoUonius of Chalcis were Stoic philosophers. 11. M. Cornelius Fronto was a rhetorician, who had been the Part of Marcus Aurelius' correspondence with Emperor's tutor. Fronto is still extant. 13. Cinna Catulus was a Stoic philosopher. 14. The allusion may be to Claudius Severus, a Stoic philosopher. 15. Claudius Maximus was a Stoic Philosopher. 17. " It is the favour of the gods that I happened to meet with a brother." The Emperor had no brother. If this refers to Lucius Verus, his adopted brother, he certainly does not deserve the praise here bestowed. BOOK II. 13, " As the poet says."—Pindar, quoted in the " Theaetetus " of Plato.

From Euripides' " Chrysippus." 51. The first two lines are from Euripides' " Supplices," 1110 1111. 66. "Leon of Salamis." In the year 404 B.C., during the terrible tyranny of " the Thirty " at Athens, Socrates was ordered to assist in unjustly arresting a rich citizen of Salamis, and bringing him to Athens for a trial that was only a mockery of justice. Socrates refused to do this ; and he alludes to this in the " But when the oligarchy of ' the Thirty ' was in " Apology." power, they sent for me and four others into the rotunda, and bade us bring Leon the Salaminian from Salamis, as they wanted That was a specimen of the sort of commands to execute him. they were always giving with a view to implicating as many as possible in their crimes ; and then I showed, not in word only, but in deed, that, if I may be allowed to use such an expression, I aired not a straw for death, and that my sole fear was the fear For the strong arm of of doing an unrighteous or unholy thing. the oppressive power did not frighten me into doing wrong, and when we came out of the rotunda, the other four went to Salamis and fetched Leon, but I went quietly home." (Plato, "Apology," p. 32, trs. by Jowett.) NOTES. " That he walked in a swaggering way." This is asserted by Aristophanes in his comedy, the " Clouds," where he ridicules Socrates. BOOK VIII. 3.

Marcus Aurelius is trying to derive the Greek word for The Such bad etymology was rays d/crii/es from the verb eKrebeadai—to be extended. explanation is obviously impossible. common at a time when no real science of words existed. BOOK IX. 29. In his " Republic," Plato sketches an ideal state in which the institutions and government are to attain perfection. BOOK X. 6. "The islands of the blest." Homer (Od. iv.) speaks of the Elysian plain at the extremity of the world, " where life is easiest for men. No snow is there, nor yet great storm, nor any rain, but alway ocean sendeth forth the breeze of the shrill west to blow cool on men." (Trs. by Butcher and Lang.) Plutarch identifies the Canaries with this description. After describing their delightful climate, he says, " So that it is generally believed even among the barbarians, that these are the Elysian fields and the seats of the blessed " (Plutarch, " Sertorius "). 21. There is a sort of play here on the word 0iXe?, which means both " loves," and " is wont." The Stoics delighted in these plays on words, and even used the names of the gods in a punning sense. but it is curiously applied. 23. The quotation is from Plato's " Theaetetus," p. 174, In the original the words are used Plato is describing the philosopher, and showing disparagingly. with what contempt he would look on the greatness of a tyrant or " Then again he observes that the great man is of necessity king. as ill-mannered and uneducated as any shepherd, for he has no 212 NOTES. leisure, and he is surrounded by a wall which is his mountainpen." (Jowett's translation.) 31. Crito was a friend of Socrates, and gave his name to one of Plato's dialogues. 34. The quotation is from Homer, " Iliad," vi. 146 BOOK XI. 6. " O Cithaeron." The words occur in one of the choruses in Sophocles' " (Edipus Tyrannus," 1. 1089. (Edipus had been exposed as an infant on Mount Cithaeron, in order to avoid the terrible doom prophesied him. 22. The first extant version of the story of the town and the country mouse occurs in Horace's " Satires," ii. 6. 26. The Ephesians are probably the followers of Heraclitus, BOOK XII. 3. Empedocles of Agrigentum was a philosopher who He was the first to establish the flourished about 444 e.g. number of four elements. These were, he thought, acted on by two moving causes—love (combination), and strife (separation). Originally the four elements were combined in a sphere where love reigned supreme, and all was peace and harmony. Strife^ which was originally outside the sphere, gradually forced its way in, and so began the period of change in which we are Empedocles wrote an epic describing the origin of the living. world, and from this the line in the text is a quotation. 34. This section refers to the Epicureans. Their doctrine made the chief good consist in pleasure, but as they believed that only virtue would afiford true pleasure, their teaching was really capable of producing noble men. Our modern term " Epicurean " in no way does justice to the teaching of Epicurus and his immediate followers. TRe C^i^I^rtury Poel?. In SHILLING Monthly Volumes, Square Svo.

It may be said generally of the poem that the most difficult scenes are those in which Miss Blind succeeds best ; and on the whole we are inclined to think that its greatest and most surprising success is the picture of the poor old soldier, Rory, driven mad by the burning of his wife." Academy. " A subject which has painfully pre-occupied public opinion is, in the poem entitled Both as 'The Heather on Fire,' treated with characteristic power by Miss Blind. . a narrative and descriptive poem, 'The Heather on Fire' is equally remarkable." Morning Post. . . " A poem remarkable for beauty of expression and pathos of incidents will be found in "The Heather on Fire." Exquisitely tfelicato are the touches with which the progress of this tale of true love is delineated up to its consummation amid the simple rejoicings of the neighbourhood ; and the flight of years of married life and daily toil, as numerous as those of their courtship, is told in stanzas full of music and soul. . . This tale is one which, unless we are mistaken, may so affect public feeling as to be an effectual bar to similar human clearings in future." Leeds Mercury. "Literature and poetry are never seen at their best save in contact with actual life. This little book abounds in vivid delineation of character, and is redolent with the noblest human sympathy." Newcastle Daily Chronicle. "The Heather on Fire" is a poem that is rich not only in power and beauty but in that " enthusiasm of humanity" which stirs and moves us, and of which so much contemporary verse is almost painfully deficient. . .
